************** Four Letter Words **************

The game starts with the user(you) choosing a
four letter word.

Then at each turn, the opponent chooses a four letter 
word that differs from the previous four letter word
EXACTLY by one character and has not been played before

For example, let 'WORD' be picked first, Then
the opponent can play 'WORE' or 'WORK' or 'WARD'
among the many options available.

'WORQ' is invalid as it is not a word
'WARE' is invalid as it differs by 2 charactes

Type 'resign' to quit the game (computer wins)
Type 'EXIT' to exit the game (game stops)
The computer accepts defeat if it has no options
to choose from.
